## Running the tests

## Exercise files

A downloaded exercise includes these files for building and testing your solution:

```text
hello-world/
├── HelloWorld.vb       # Your solution
├── HelloWorldTests.vb  # The test suite
├── HelloWorld.vbproj   # Project and build configuration
└── packages.lock.json  # Resolved project dependencies
```

The filenames vary by exercise.
Write your solution in the `.vb` file whose name does not end in `Tests`.
The file ending in `Tests.vb` is the xUnit test suite; normally, you should edit it only to remove `Skip` arguments.
You normally do not need to edit the project or lock file.

## Run the tests

Open a terminal in the exercise directory and run:

```bash
dotnet test
```

The command restores the project's dependencies, builds the project, and runs its tests.
You can also use `dotnet watch test` to rerun the tests whenever a source file changes.

## Skipped tests

Exercises initially enable only the first test, allowing you to solve the rest one step at a time.
Open the file ending in `Tests.vb` to find the tests.
Each test is a `Sub` subroutine marked with an xUnit `<Fact>` attribute.
A test will be skipped as long as its `<Fact>` attribute has a `Skip` argument:

```vb
<Fact(Skip:="Remove this Skip property to run this test")>
Public Sub Lowercase_words()
    Assert.Equal("ROR", Abbreviate("Ruby on Rails"))
End Sub
```

To enable the test, just remove the `Skip` argument:

```vb
<Fact>
Public Sub Lowercase_words()
    Assert.Equal("ROR", Abbreviate("Ruby on Rails"))
End Sub
```

After the newly enabled test passes, repeat this process with the next skipped test.
When every test is enabled and passing, you're done.

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit CustomSet.vb` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
