# High Scores

Welcome to High Scores on Exercism's Pyret Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

Many of our lower-level Pyret exercises are solveable with only [function application expressions] in the form of `foo(1)` . This exercise however expects that [dot expressions] can be used to access data and method fields on what your function returns. This can be done with [object expressions], allowing you to access the fields of an object literal. [Data declarations] are a similar but more advanced approach that utilizes data and method fields as well.
